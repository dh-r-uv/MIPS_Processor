# MIPS_Processor

## Instructions to run this code on your device

clone this repository in your local device. This project contains two types of processors:- `Non-Pipelined` and `Pipelined`, also contains two `.png` files that showcases how the processor work

## Commands this processor can handle 

```opcodes
#Rformats
RFORMAT = '000000'
ADD = '000000'
SUB = '000000'
AND = '000000'
OR = '000000'
SLT = '000000'

#Iformats
BEQ = '000100'
LW = '100011'
SW = '101011'
ADDI = '001000'

#Jformats
J = '000010'

#MUL
MUL = '011100'
```
